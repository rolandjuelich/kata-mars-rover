Sterring a mars rover

Narrative:
In order to explore mars safely
As a scientist
I want to use a mars rover 
					 
Scenario: the mars rover moves forward
Given a mars rover
And its location is 0,0
And its heading is north
When it moves forward
Then its expected to be at 0,1
And its expected to be heading north
